In the wake of an unprecedented global health crisis, the impact of COVID-19 has been profound, with over one million cases reported in the United States alone (CDC, 2023). The pervasive threat of contracting the virus and its severe consequences underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of its dynamics. This project aims to delve into the depths of COVID-19 data, employing a meticulous analysis to extract insightful perspectives. The overarching goal is to construct a predictive model that can discern whether a patient is at high risk or not, facilitating enhanced preparedness and patient care. Through this endeavor, the focus will be on identifying the major factors that significantly contribute to placing individuals in the high-risk category, thereby contributing valuable insights to the ongoing battle against the pandemic.
